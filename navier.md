Head of Machine Learning
About Navier AI
Navier AI is building the first autonomous engineering agents—AI systems that can
design, simulate, and optimize complex products to achieve breakthrough levels of
performance. Our mission is to enable engineers to move beyond today’s slow, manual
design cycles by providing agents that reason about physics, explore design trade-offs,
and generate high-performance solutions across aerospace, automotive, and advanced
manufacturing.
We’re backed by top-tier investors and work directly with industry leaders to deploy AI-
native tools that go far beyond today’s design automation.
Role Overview
We’re seeking a Head of Machine Learning to lead the development of perception and
representation models that power our autonomous engineering agents. This is a
strategic leadership role where you’ll define the technical vision, guide research
direction, and build a world-class ML team. Your work will enable agents to interpret
CAD files, simulation data, and 3D environments—bridging the gap between raw
geometry and engineering decisions.
Responsibilities
• Develop perception models that extract structure, semantics, and key features
from 3D geometry (CAD models, meshes, point clouds, simulation outputs)
• Create representations and embeddings that agents can use to reason about
geometry, physics, and constraints
• Build multimodal pipelines that integrate visual, geometric, and language-based
inputs to provide rich context for LLM-driven agents
• Work with simulation and CAD data to build datasets, labeling pipelines, and
training workflows tailored to engineering contexts
• Collaborate closely with agent, frontend, and infra teams to deploy perception
models and ensure fast, scalable inference
• Explore and implement techniques such as 3D transformers, geometric deep
learning, diffusion models, and structured reasoning
• Help shape the research direction for context-aware AI agents operating in
engineering domains
Qualifications
Required:
• Proven experience leading ML teams and delivering production-grade models
• Deep expertise in 3D perception or scene understanding (bonus points for
robotics, autonomous vehicles, AR/VR, or similar domains)
• Strong ML engineering skills in Python and PyTorch (or equivalent frameworks)
• Familiarity with 3D data formats (e.g., meshes, point clouds, SDFs, occupancy
grids, STL/STEP/CAD)
• Knowledge of neural networks for geometric data (e.g., PointNet++, 3D CNNs,
graph neural networks, or NeRF-style models)
• Experience building and deploying ML models end-to-end, from data curation to
evaluation and inference
• Ability to thrive in fast-paced, ambiguous environments and ship without perfect
specs
Nice to have:
• Background in mechanical, aerospace, or robotics engineering
• Experience integrating perception models with LLMs, planners, or task agents
• Prior work with engineering simulation data (e.g., CFD, FEA) or CAD tools
• Experience with multi-agent systems, reinforcement learning, or real-time
perception
• Interest in pushing the boundaries of how AI understands the physical world
Why This Role Matters
For AI agents to reason about physical systems, they need to see and understand
geometry like an engineer. This role is foundational to giving our agents that capability.
You’ll define how structure, spatial relationships, and physical constraints are
represented and used—enabling AI to go beyond text and truly grasp the design space.
What We Offer
• Competitive compensation, including salary and equity
• Direct exposure to high-impact technical problems in aerospace, automotive,
and advanced manufacturing
• Opportunity to define a new category of engineering software and build a world-
class ML organization
