  Dear Hiring Manager,

  I am writing to express my interest in the Senior ML Software Engineer role on the Music Creation Apps team. With several years of experience building end-to-end machine learning systems for real-time, hardware-constrained environments, and a formal background in music theory and performance, I am excited by the opportunity to help shape the next generation of AI-driven music creation tools at Apple.

  In my current role as a Senior Machine Learning Engineer at Machina Labs, I lead the design and deployment of ML models that run on edge devices to control industrial robotic sheet-metal forming. I own the full lifecycle from data collection and labeling, through model design and training, to optimization and deployment on resource-constrained hardware. This includes building robust data and experimentation infrastructure (data warehousing, ETL, metrics, dashboards) and collaborating closely with software, controls, and robotics engineers to ship reliable, production features. This experience maps directly onto the challenges of integrating ML into Logic Pro and GarageBand, where latency, reliability, and user experience are all critical.

  Previously, as a Ph.D. researcher and postdoctoral scholar in physics at UC Irvine, I developed deep learning and computer vision methods for high-energy physics detectors. I worked across the entire ML pipeline on large, complex datasets: simulation and data generation, preprocessing, feature engineering, model architecture design, hyperparameter optimization, and rigorous evaluation with an emphasis on interpretability. I am comfortable collaborating with diverse experts, iterating quickly from idea to prototype to production-grade systems, and communicating technical decisions clearly to both specialists and non-specialists.

  Alongside my technical background, I have a minor in music with formal training in music theory and performance. Music has been a consistent part of my life, and I care deeply about tools that expand what creators can do without diminishing their artistic ownership. The prospect of building ML features that feel like creative partners—surfacing intelligent assistance at the right moment while preserving full creative control—perfectly aligns with how I think about human-centered AI.

  I would be thrilled to bring my experience in real-time, on-device ML systems and my long-standing connection to music to the Music Creation Apps team. Thank you for your time and consideration; I would welcome the chance to discuss how I can contribute to the future of AI-assisted music creation at Apple.

  \
  Sincerely, \
