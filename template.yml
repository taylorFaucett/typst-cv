          Senior Machine Learning Engineer and physicist with 8+ years developing and benchmarking ML algorithms across research and production, including 3D perception, scene understanding, and geometric reasoning.
          Build and ship Python/PyTorch systems end-to-end: dataset curation/labeling, training + evaluation, and real-time deployment in air-gapped/edge environments (e.g., ONNX, Rust `no_std`), with monitoring and regression benchmarks.
          Deep expertise in geometric deep learning (PointNet-style models, 3D CNNs, graph networks), physics-informed models for material behavior, and multimodal pipelines integrating 3D geometry with transformer/LLM-based agent interfaces under safety and latency constraints.

        description: |
          - Lead end-to-end ML for industrial robotic sheet-metal forming, from dataset curation and labeling pipelines through model design, evaluation, and deployment for real-time inference in air-gapped robotic cells.
          - Train real-time anomaly detection models deployed on edge devices, enabling in-process quality monitoring and early fault detection during robotic forming operations.
          - Develop and maintain benchmark suites for model quality and edge inference performance (accuracy/latency), integrating regression tests and monitoring to catch data drift and performance degradation.
          - Develop embedded-compatible inference components in Rust (`no_std`) to support constrained deployments; validate real-time inference on industrial PCs under latency budgets.
          - Develop physics-informed ML models trained on material stamping literature to predict failure likelihood, incorporating material properties and forming parameters to prevent defects.
          - Build mesh adjustment models for Double-Sided Incremental Forming (DSIF) that learn springback compensation—predicting geometry corrections so parts resolve to their final desired shape after elastic recovery.
          - Create learned embeddings and representations from 3D geometry (meshes, point clouds, CAD) that encode spatial structure and physical constraints for downstream reasoning and path planning.
          - Build multimodal pipelines combining geometric context with language-based interfaces for LLM-driven robot operation, focusing on tool use, constrained action spaces, and operational safety.
          - Own data infrastructure (ETL, dataset versioning, metrics/dashboards, monitoring) and mentor junior engineers on ML best practices and geometric data pipelines.
          - Partner with robotics, controls, and software teams to integrate ML into safety-critical systems, including CI/CD and infrastructure-as-code for deployed robotic cells.
