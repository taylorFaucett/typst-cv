        description: |
          - Lead end-to-end ML for industrial robotic sheet-metal forming, from dataset curation and labeling pipelines through model design, evaluation, and deployment on edge hardware for real-time inference.
          - Train real-time anomaly detection models deployed on edge devices, enabling in-process quality monitoring and early fault detection during robotic forming operations.
          - Develop physics-informed ML models trained on material stamping literature to predict failure likelihood, incorporating material properties and forming parameters to prevent defects.
          - Build mesh adjustment models for Double-Sided Incremental Forming (DSIF) that learn springback compensation—predicting geometry corrections so parts resolve to their final desired shape after elastic recovery.
          - Create learned embeddings and representations from 3D geometry (meshes, point clouds, CAD) that encode spatial structure and physical constraints for downstream reasoning and path planning.
          - Build multimodal pipelines combining geometric context with language-based interfaces for LLM-driven robot operation, focusing on constrained action spaces and operational safety.
          - Own data infrastructure (ETL, dataset versioning, metrics/dashboards, monitoring) and mentor junior engineers on ML best practices and geometric data pipelines.
          - Partner with robotics, controls, and software teams to integrate ML into safety-critical systems, including CI/CD and infrastructure-as-code for deployed robotic cells.
